> **Part of the [Mesh Pilot](https://meshpilot.app) open-source 6-agent marketing stack.**
> Autonomous outbound B2B sales operator — discovery → enrichment → LLM drafting → human-in-the-loop approval → send → learn from outcomes.

The agent builds a lead funnel from public sources, drafts personalised opening emails, and queues every draft for approval before anything leaves your inbox. Replies, bounces, and unsubscribes route back to the lead row so the funnel learns who's worth the next touch.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/nuraveda-lab/ai-sales-agent.git
# or: git clone https://codeberg.org/Nuraveda_lab/ai-sales-agent.git
cd ai-sales-agent

uv pip install -e .          # or: pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env         # Google Places + LLM + Resend + Discord keys
alembic upgrade head         # apply migrations

python -m sales_agent.server
```

## What it does

- **Discovery** — scans a configured region/segment via Google Places to build a lead funnel.
- **Enrichment** — pulls company + contact data on each lead, scoring fit.
- **Drafter** — LLM writes a personalised opening cold email per lead, marked `pending` in the database.
- **HITL** — pending drafts surface in a Discord channel for approver thumbs-up. Nothing sends until you click.
- **Sender** — approved drafts go out through Resend (or any SMTP provider) within a configurable time window.
- **Reply tracking** — bounces, unsubscribes, and replies route back to the lead row so the funnel learns over time.

## The HITL pattern (shared across the stack)

Every action that touches money, brand voice, or outbound delivery routes through a human-in-the-loop approval gate. This agent never auto-sends. Drafts land in a queue (Discord by default; the [Mesh Pilot](https://meshpilot.app) cockpit adds a web inbox + Telegram mirrors) and execute only after explicit operator approval. The audit log records who approved what, when, on which channel.
